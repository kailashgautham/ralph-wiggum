[DONE] Fix entrypoint.sh to use RALPH_SSH_KEY for dynamic SSH setup: entrypoint.sh unconditionally checks for /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 and exports GIT_SSH_COMMAND pointing at that path; docker-ralph.sh now mounts whichever key RALPH_SSH_KEY points to under its original basename (e.g. id_rsa), but entrypoint.sh never consults RALPH_SSH_KEY so the GIT_SSH_COMMAND is wrong for any key other than id_ed25519; add RALPH_SSH_KEY to docker-ralph.sh's ENV_ARGS block, then update entrypoint.sh to derive the mounted key path from RALPH_SSH_KEY (defaulting to id_ed25519) so the SSH command is always set up for the correct key
[DONE] Guard against missing known_hosts file in docker-ralph.sh: docker-ralph.sh unconditionally adds -v "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:/root/.ssh/known_hosts:ro" to the docker run command; if the file does not exist on the host, Docker errors with "invalid mount config for type bind: bind source path does not exist" which looks like a Ralph bug; add a file-existence check and skip the mount with a clear informational warning when ~/.ssh/known_hosts is absent, so users on fresh machines get a useful message instead of a confusing Docker error
