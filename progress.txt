[DONE] Remove the duplicate run_claude() function from ralph.sh and replace it with a call to ralph_run_main_call() from ralph-lib.sh: ralph.sh still contains its own local run_claude() function (defined around line 215) that is nearly identical to ralph_run_main_call() added to ralph-lib.sh; the extraction task only updated ralph-once.sh but left ralph.sh with its own copy; delete run_claude() from ralph.sh, replace the call to run_claude on the loop iteration line with ralph_run_main_call "$PROMPT", and confirm that OUTPUT is still set correctly for the COMPLETE check and log write that follow
[DONE] Extract the status and --dry-run subcommand logic into shared ralph-lib.sh functions: both ralph.sh (lines 47–116) and ralph-once.sh (lines 43–112) contain verbatim copies of the same status-printing loop (mapfile, for-task, grep -qxF, COMPLETED/REMAINING arrays) and the same next-task finder; add ralph_show_status() and ralph_next_task() functions to ralph-lib.sh and replace the duplicated blocks in both scripts with calls to these functions; update the source line so ralph-once.sh sources ralph-lib.sh before the status/dry-run subcommand checks (it currently sources after the --help check but before status, which is correct, but verify)
