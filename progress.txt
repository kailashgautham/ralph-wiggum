[DONE] Make git identity configurable via env vars in entrypoint.sh: entrypoint.sh hardcodes a specific person's name and email in `git config --global user.name/email`, making every commit inside the container appear to be authored by that individual regardless of who is running Ralph; add RALPH_GIT_NAME and RALPH_GIT_EMAIL env vars (defaulting to the current values so existing behaviour is preserved), substitute them into the git config calls, and forward both vars from docker-ralph.sh's ENV_ARGS block
[DONE] Extract shared git commit/push/PR logic into a sourced ralph-lib.sh helper: ralph.sh contains the commit→branch→push→PR creation workflow in two places (normal iteration and cycle-rewrite), and ralph-once.sh contains a third near-identical copy; any bug fix or enhancement to this flow currently requires three coordinated edits; extract the repeated block into a function in a new ralph-lib.sh file that both scripts source, accepting the branch name prefix and commit message as arguments
