[DONE] Fix entrypoint.sh default git identity to match documented values: RALPH_GIT_NAME defaults to "Kailash Gautham" and RALPH_GIT_EMAIL defaults to "kailash.gautham@gmail.com" in entrypoint.sh, but docker-ralph.sh --help documents these as defaulting to "Ralph" and "ralph@example.com"; this is a template repo meant for others to use, so the hardcoded personal name and email are wrong defaults; update the fallback values in entrypoint.sh to use "Ralph" and "ralph@example.com" to match the documented behaviour
