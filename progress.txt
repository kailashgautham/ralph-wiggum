[DONE] Extract the COMPLETE-handling block into a shared ralph_handle_complete() function in ralph-lib.sh: both ralph.sh (lines 206–228) and ralph-once.sh (lines 132–151) contain nearly identical logic that detects <promise>COMPLETE</promise> in OUTPUT, calls ralph_run_planning_call with the planning prompt, archives progress.txt to logs/, resets progress.txt to its header, and conditionally commits via ralph_commit_push_pr; extract this logic into a single ralph_handle_complete() function in ralph-lib.sh that accepts an iteration-label string parameter (e.g. "iteration $i" or "single iteration") used in the commit message and log output, and replace both duplicated blocks in ralph.sh and ralph-once.sh with calls to the new function
