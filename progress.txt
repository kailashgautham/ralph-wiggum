[DONE] Fix entrypoint.sh default git identity to match documented values: RALPH_GIT_NAME defaults to "Kailash Gautham" and RALPH_GIT_EMAIL defaults to "kailash.gautham@gmail.com" in entrypoint.sh, but docker-ralph.sh --help documents these as defaulting to "Ralph" and "ralph@example.com"; this is a template repo meant for others to use, so the hardcoded personal name and email are wrong defaults; update the fallback values in entrypoint.sh to use "Ralph" and "ralph@example.com" to match the documented behaviour
[DONE] Extract the main-call retry loop in ralph-once.sh into a shared ralph-lib.sh function: the inline retry block in ralph-once.sh (lines 93–119, building CMD, running with optional timeout, capturing PIPESTATUS, sleeping with exponential backoff, and setting CLAUDE_EXIT) is nearly identical to the body of run_claude() in ralph.sh; the planning-call equivalent was already extracted as ralph_run_planning_call but the main call was not; add a ralph_run_main_call function to ralph-lib.sh that accepts the prompt string, uses the same globals (CLAUDE_MODEL, RALPH_TIMEOUT, RALPH_ALLOWED_TOOLS, MAX_RETRIES, RETRY_DELAY, LOGS_DIR), writes captured output to a nameref or a shared OUTPUT variable, and replace the inline block in ralph-once.sh with a call to this function so both scripts share one retry implementation
[DONE] Add tests for RALPH_LOG_KEEP validation and log-rotation skip: validate_non_negative_int was introduced to accept RALPH_LOG_KEEP=0 but there are no tests verifying this; add a test to tests/run_tests.sh that running ralph.sh with RALPH_LOG_KEEP=0 and a no-op mock claude exits 0 without a validation error, and a second test that RALPH_LOG_KEEP=abc exits 1 with a message matching "must be a non-negative integer"
