[DONE] Fix Dockerfile to copy ralph-lib.sh into the image: the COPY instruction in Dockerfile lists only ralph.sh, ralph-once.sh, and entrypoint.sh, but both ralph.sh and ralph-once.sh source ralph-lib.sh at startup; the container therefore fails immediately with a "No such file or directory" error on every run; add ralph-lib.sh to the COPY line and to the chmod +x line so it is present and executable inside the image
[DONE] Allow RALPH_LOG_KEEP=0 to disable log rotation by fixing validate_int usage: ralph.sh treats RALPH_LOG_KEEP=0 as "keep all logs, skip rotation" (the rotation block is guarded by `if [ "${RALPH_LOG_KEEP}" -gt 0 ]`), but validate_int uses the regex `^[1-9][0-9]*$` which rejects zero; a user who sets RALPH_LOG_KEEP=0 gets a misleading "must be a positive integer" error instead of the intended behaviour; introduce a separate validate_non_negative_int helper (accepting 0 or any positive integer) and use it for RALPH_LOG_KEEP while keeping validate_int for values that must be at least 1
[DONE] Update README.md Files table and architecture section to document ralph-lib.sh and tests/: both ralph-lib.sh (the shared helper library) and the tests/ directory were introduced in recent iterations but are absent from the README's Files table and architecture description; add a row for ralph-lib.sh explaining it is a sourced helper with shared functions, add a row for tests/run_tests.sh explaining it is the test harness, and add a brief "Testing" subsection describing how to run the tests manually
