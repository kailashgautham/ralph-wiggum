[DONE] Add kailash.gautham@gmail.com, Kailash Gautham as the main committer and co-authored by ralph. And use a PR and merging workflow.
[DONE] Add retry logic to the main Claude invocation in ralph-once.sh: ralph-once.sh runs Claude once and exits immediately on any non-zero exit code; unlike ralph.sh which wraps the call in a run_claude() function with up to MAX_RETRIES attempts and exponential backoff, a transient API error in ralph-once.sh aborts the entire run; replicate the same retry loop (up to MAX_RETRIES, with BACKOFF = RETRY_DELAY * 2^(attempt-1) capped at 60s) around the main Claude call in ralph-once.sh so single-iteration runs are equally resilient to transient failures
