# Ralph Self-Improvement Plan

Ralph is a self-improving loop. Each iteration, Claude reads this file and progress.txt, picks the next uncompleted task, implements it, commits the change, and marks it done.

**Important:** If all tasks are completed, review the codebase for weaknesses and append new improvement tasks to the Tasks section below before proceeding. There should always be work to do.

## Tasks
- [ ] Extract the COMPLETE-handling block into a shared ralph_handle_complete() function in ralph-lib.sh: both ralph.sh (lines 206–228) and ralph-once.sh (lines 132–151) contain nearly identical logic that detects <promise>COMPLETE</promise> in OUTPUT, calls ralph_run_planning_call with the planning prompt, archives progress.txt to logs/, resets progress.txt to its header, and conditionally commits via ralph_commit_push_pr; extract this logic into a single ralph_handle_complete() function in ralph-lib.sh that accepts an iteration-label string parameter (e.g. "iteration $i" or "single iteration") used in the commit message and log output, and replace both duplicated blocks in ralph.sh and ralph-once.sh with calls to the new function
- [ ] Add a RALPH_PLAN_PROMPT environment variable to allow users to override the planning prompt without editing source files: ralph.sh (line 212) and ralph-once.sh (line 136) both hardcode the same planning prompt string; move this string into ralph-lib.sh as a module-level default (RALPH_DEFAULT_PLAN_PROMPT), then in ralph_handle_complete() (or wherever ralph_run_planning_call is invoked) use ${RALPH_PLAN_PROMPT:-$RALPH_DEFAULT_PLAN_PROMPT} so users can supply a custom planning prompt via the environment; document RALPH_PLAN_PROMPT in ralph.sh --help, ralph-once.sh --help, docker-ralph.sh --help, README.md's environment variables table, and add it to docker-ralph.sh's ENV_ARGS forwarding block
- [ ] Make docker-ralph.sh status and --dry-run call ralph.sh directly on the host instead of building the Docker image: lines 165–175 of docker-ralph.sh run docker build and docker run purely to execute ralph.sh status or ralph.sh --dry-run, which are read-only operations that require no container sandbox; replace this block with a direct exec of ralph.sh (resolved relative to docker-ralph.sh's own directory via dirname) so that status and dry-run are instant; if ralph.sh is not found in the same directory, print an error and exit 1
- [ ] Add a test verifying that RALPH_LOG_KEEP=N actually deletes old log files beyond the keep limit: tests 8 and 9 only verify that RALPH_LOG_KEEP=0 and RALPH_LOG_KEEP=abc pass/fail input validation; add a new test that pre-populates the logs/ directory of a setup_repo with more dummy .log files than the keep limit (e.g. 5 files when RALPH_LOG_KEEP=3), runs ralph.sh 1 with a mock no-op claude, and asserts that the logs/ directory contains exactly RALPH_LOG_KEEP log files (plus the one just written) and that the oldest dummy files were removed
- [ ] Add a test that verifies the prompt.txt override is used instead of the default prompt: both ralph.sh and ralph-once.sh read prompt.txt from the project root when it exists and pass its contents to claude, but no test exercises this path; add a test that creates a prompt.txt with a recognisable sentinel string in a setup_repo directory, installs a mock claude that writes its -p argument to a capture file, runs ralph.sh 1 (or ralph-once.sh), and asserts that the captured prompt equals the sentinel from prompt.txt and does not contain the default prompt text
- [ ] Add a RALPH_COMPLETE_HOOK environment variable that executes a user-supplied shell command when ralph.sh exits via any of its three terminal paths (COMPLETE, stall limit reached, or max iterations reached): operators running long unattended loops have no notification mechanism; when RALPH_COMPLETE_HOOK is set, export RALPH_EXIT_REASON (set to "complete", "stall", or "max_iterations" as appropriate) and run eval "$RALPH_COMPLETE_HOOK" immediately before each exit so the hook can distinguish outcomes; document RALPH_COMPLETE_HOOK and RALPH_EXIT_REASON in ralph.sh --help, docker-ralph.sh --help, and README.md
- [ ] Fix docker-ralph.sh cleanup to avoid word-splitting when passing container and image IDs to docker rm and docker rmi: lines 128 and 145 use 'docker rm -f $CONTAINERS' and 'docker rmi $DANGLING' where CONTAINERS and DANGLING are newline-separated strings held in plain variables; replace these with mapfile-based arrays (mapfile -t arr < <(docker ps -a ...)) and expand as "${arr[@]}" so each ID is a separate argument and the commands remain correct even if Docker ever returns IDs containing unexpected whitespace
- [ ] Fix unsafe ls | xargs rm in ralph.sh log rotation: line 113 uses 'ls -t | tail -n +N | xargs rm -f' to delete old log files, which is unsafe because xargs splits on whitespace so any log filename containing spaces would be treated as multiple arguments; replace with a mapfile-based approach (mapfile -t _log_files < <(ls -t "$LOGS_DIR") then iterate "${_log_files[@]:$RALPH_LOG_KEEP}" with rm -f) so each filename is handled as a single argument regardless of whitespace
- [ ] Remove the redundant '| tail -1' after grep -c in ralph.sh: lines 179 and 191 assign DONE_BEFORE and DONE_AFTER via 'grep -c ... | tail -1'; grep -c always outputs exactly one line (a count), so the pipe to tail -1 is unnecessary noise that suggests multiple lines could be returned when they cannot; remove '| tail -1' from both assignments and assign the grep -c output directly
- [ ] Log git pull failures in ralph-lib.sh instead of silently ignoring them: line 94 runs 'git pull --ff-only origin "$RALPH_BASE_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true' which discards all output and always succeeds; if the pull fails (network issue, auth failure, diverged history), the loop continues with a stale local branch and there is no indication anything went wrong; replace '2>/dev/null || true' with a conditional that calls _ralph_log with a warning message when the pull exits non-zero, so operators can detect sync problems in the run log
- [ ] Add tests for invalid MAX argument values and for running ralph.sh when PRD.md has no uncompleted tasks: ralph.sh validates MAX with validate_int but there is no test for negative values, zero, or non-numeric strings; additionally there is no test for the case where PRD.md exists but contains no unchecked tasks (all tasks already done or the file has no task lines); add a test that passes MAX=0 and asserts a non-zero exit with an error message, a test that passes MAX=-1 and asserts the same, and a test that sets up a repo with a PRD.md whose only tasks are all marked [x] and a progress.txt reflecting them, runs ralph.sh 1 with a mock claude, and asserts that ralph exits cleanly without calling claude (since there is nothing to do)
